      <h2>A Brief introduction about me</h2>
      <p>Programming has been my passion from high school.Learning new technologies
         is my greatest skill. I had opportunities to study different programming
          languages at different stages of my life.I have a strong passion  to develop
          programs which are faster, simple and easy to follow. Web application
          development being my most recently acquired skill would like to utilize it to
          the maximum in my next job position.
