      <h2>A Brief introduction about me</h2>
      <p>Programming has been my passion from high school.Learning new technologies
         is my greatest skill. I had opportunities to study different programming
          languages at different stages of my life.I have a strong passion  to develop
          programs which are faster, simple and easy to follow. Web application
          development being my most recently acquired skill would like to utilize it to
          the maximum in my next job position.

     I completed the Bootcamp program for Web application development at Denver Univeristy.
     This intense training program helped me in acquiring skills like HTML, CSS, JAvascript,
      Node.js, React.js, MongoDb, Mongoose,MySQL. Here I was required to complete weekly assignments
      these assignments gave me the oppurtunity to understand anddevelop applications using new technologies
      and concepts. Apart from weekly Assignments I also had the oppurtunity to develop 3 projects.
      The first project is a front end application.
